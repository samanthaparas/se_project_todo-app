# Easy Peezy To-Do App

Project 7's main focus was to refactor existing Javascript in OOP.

## Functionality

First, I needed to update the project's file structure by adding in a new folder and a files. I created a Todo class and made sure it accepted the data and selector arguments. I needed to create a private setEventListener method for the delete button and checkbox. Typically, IDs are generated by a database, but since this was a project, I used preexisting code from the uuid package. After, I focused on the FormValidator accepting two parameters: first settings objects that tores the necessary selectors and classes, and the second taking a form element to be validated. The last step was ensuring that the forms would reset and form controls after submission.

## Technology

Javascript and HTML/CSS + OOP were utilized.

## Deployment
