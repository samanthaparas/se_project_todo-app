# The Simple To-Do App

Project 8's main focus was to refactor The Simple To-Do app to use object-oriented programming (OOP) by creating separate classes that each handle a specific task such as rendering to-dos, managing popups, handling form submissions, and tracking completed items. I have also added a new TodoCounter class that dynamically updates the number of total and completed to-dos, improving structure, reusability, and maintainability.

## Functionality

The Simple To-Do app allows users to create task, mark task when completed, delete task, count total completed task, and also track due dates.

## Technology

Javascript and HTML/CSS + OOP were utilized.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
